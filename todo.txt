1. process
2. Compile time warnings
	i. Function with no return type that does not have a print statement
	ii. Functions with identical names (second one will wipe over the first - there is no polymorphism)
	iii. Changed type of a variable.
3. Input error checking
4. pipe err messages to stderr (tho i think it might be doing that already) 
-- CONSIDER BEFORE DOING THIS
5. fix stream on one line and stream on the next failing as it thinks it should be parsing the latter as a streamget -- FIXED BY ADDING semicolons, maybe work on removing again. UNFIXED (maybe, maybe it wasnt compiled and semicolons do work). 
6. better type error messages (line and col number for AlexPosn; show error line from source code)
7. Syntax highlighting
8. First-class functions
9. Block scope
