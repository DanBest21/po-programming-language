1. type checker DONE
2. functions
3. process
3.5 pipe err messages to stderr (tho i think it might be doing that already)
4. try to get more accurate parsing error messages DONE
4.5. on vardec and varassign, return what gets assigned (so can have a var in an if or something) DONE
5. += -= etc. DONE
5.5. fix stream on one line and stream on the next failing as it thinks it should be parsing the latter as a streamget -- FIXED BY ADDING semicolons, maybe work on removing again. UNFIXED (maybe, maybe it wasnt compiled and semicolons do work). 
5.8 and/or DONE
-- CONSIDER BEFORE DOING THIS
6. better type error messages (line and col number for AlexPosn; show error line from source code)
