1. process DONE
2. Compile time warnings
	i. Function with no return type that does not have a print statement
	ii. Functions with identical names (second one will wipe over the first - there is no polymorphism)
	iii. Changed type of a variable.
3. Input error checking DONE
-- CONSIDER BEFORE DOING THIS
5. First-class functions
6. Import libraries
	i. Prelude/Standard library - including fold
7. Syntax highlighting
100. Block scope
101. better type error messages (line and col number for AlexPosn; show error line from source code)
1000. fix stream on one line and stream on the next failing as it thinks it should be parsing the latter as a streamget -- FIXED BY ADDING semicolons, maybe work on removing again. UNFIXED (maybe, maybe it wasnt compiled and semicolons do work).
